    CSS ==> Cascading Style Sheet
    Check "CSS Zen Garden" to see how the same content can be rendered in different styles
    3 ways/methods to apply/configure the styles
    starting from the more specific to the general and more global ones:
    - Inline Styles
    - Embedded (Internal) Styles
    - External Styles
    - Imported Styles
    External Styles:
    All style rules will be written in an external file (not in the same HTML file)
    this external file will have the extension of ".css",
    this file must be connected/linked to our html file
    Internal (Embedded) Styles:
    All style rules will be written inside the <head> element of our html file
    inside <style> and </style> tags
    Inline Styles:
    All style rules will be written as attributes for the html elements
    Imported styles (Not used frequently):
    Are similar to external styles for connecting with a separate file
    that contains the CSS code.
    This file can be imported into:
    - embedded styles
    - another external style sheet
    by using @import directive
    This extra one:
    - Imported Styles => @import(.....) usually used with Google fonts
    Review:
    <element attribute="value">content</element>
    HTML ==> <h1 id="test">Head Title<h1>
    Selector {
        Property: value; ==> Declaration
    }
    Using External Style Sheet:
    the styles are inside a separate (external) file
    since that file contains only CSS rules and NO HTML
    the extension of that file will be .css and Not .html
    Example:
    styles.css or style.css or my-styles.css or abc-style.css
    -->

    <!--
        Using External CSS:
        -------------------
        Add a link to an external CSS file named "css-intro.css" which is inside a sub-folder named "css"
        to apply/use external css file in our html page => link element
        we need to add:
         - href="??? File name and location ??"
         - rel="stylesheet"
        NOTE:
        In XHTML syntax, type attribute with the value of "text/css" is required.
        - type="text/css"
        It's an optional attribute with HTML5 (W3C validator will not complaint):
        - type="text/css"
        Notice by default VS code will generate: <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
        We need to place this line in the head element of every HTML page
    -->

    <!--
            We will use External Style Sheet File
            The link must be inside <head> element
            We used to add the attribute: 
            type="text/css" ==> No need with HTML5
    -->
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- Internal Styles:
         Warning:
         The [type="text/css"] attribute for the <style> element is NOT needed
         It should be omitted ==> type="text/css"
         This is the way it used to be, but no more with HTML5
         So W3C will give us this Warning Message if you use it: The type attribute for the style element is not needed and should be omitted.
         -->
    <style>
        /* We put all our internal styles inside this <style> element that is inside <header> element */
    </style>
